# PhD_screeningcompound_analysis
- My PhD involved synthesising compounds that would be good starting points in drug discovery. 
- The compound properties were analysed using python and used in my thesis.
- The compounds I synthesised were sent for biological evaluation to a set of universities around the world.
- I recieved the results from each university where I combined each excel spread sheet, using python.
- This repository shows the combination of data and an analysis of the compounds.
