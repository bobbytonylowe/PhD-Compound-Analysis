# PhD_screeningcompound_analysis

-	My PhD has consisted of developing molecular scaffolds with pharmacological parameters appropriate for drug discovery with the use of computational analysis. 
- I have designed and synthesised a library of novel compounds, and interpreted complex domain-specific data (> 200 compounds).

# Results (All compounds and analysis.ipynb)
- I have recieved various biological results from a range of collaborators. 
- The records were combined using python.

# Analysis (PhD analysis.ipynb)
- Here the data was visualised and used within my thesis. 

# PMI.ipynb
- This file involves the code to produce a PMI plot, which was used several times to visualise thousands of compounds.
 
# Filtering_data
- Here I have included some of the ways I filtered my data
- This includes using SQL in python
